    Good for projects with clear requirements
    Easier to estimate cost and timeline early on
Disadvantages of Waterfall:
    Not suitable for complex or flexible projects
    Hard to go back and fix things
    No working product until the end
    High risk if requirements are misunderstood early
## 4. In what types of projects might Agile be more beneficial than Waterfall, and vice versa? Can you provide examples of each?
When Agile is More Beneficial:
Best for:
    Projects where requirements may change
    Projects that need frequent updates or user feedback
    Projects with fast-moving environments
    Projects focused on customer satisfaction
✅ Examples:
    Mobile App Development:
        Features and designs change based on user feedback.
        Frequent updates and improvements are needed.
When Waterfall is More Beneficial:
Best for:
    Projects with well-defined, unchanging requirements
    Projects with strict deadlines or regulatory needs
    Projects with little need for frequent updates
✅ Examples:
    Construction Project (like building a hospital):
        You can’t start building the roof before the foundation.
        Each step must be completed in order.
## 5. What are some methods for ensuring quality assurance throughout a software project? Why is it important to maintain high standards?
Requirements Review
    Make sure the project requirements are clear, complete, and agreed upon before development starts.
    Prevents building the wrong thing.
Code Reviews

    Supports Long-Term Success:
    Cleaner code is easier to update, scale, and maintain.
    
## 6. How does defining the project scope contribute to successful project planning? What is a Work Breakdown Structure (WBS), and why is it useful?
Here’s why defining scope is important:
    Clear Direction:
    Everyone knows what’s expected, so the team stays focused.
    Prevents Scope Creep:
    Stops the project from growing out of control with extra features or tasks that weren’t planned.
    Better Time and Cost Estimates:
    When you know exactly what needs to be done, it’s easier to plan your schedule and budget.
    Improves Communication:
    Stakeholders, clients, and the team all stay on the same page.
    Easier to Track Progress:
    You can measure success based on what was originally agreed upon.
A Work Breakdown Structure (WBS) is a tool that breaks the entire project into smaller, manageable parts.
Why is WBS Useful?
    Better Planning:
    Helps identify everything that needs to be done—no missed steps.    Improves Time Management:
    Each task can be scheduled more accurately.
    Assigns Responsibilities Clearly:
    Each small task can be given to the right person or team.
    Easier to Track Progress:
    You can check off tasks as you go and spot delays early.
    Supports Budgeting:
    Helps estimate costs by task or phase.

## 7. What are the benefits of developing a detailed project schedule, and how can Gantt charts assist in this process?
